# Naval-battle-Game
```Game Development:```
 An interactive Naval Battle game was implemented, allowing players to define the size of the board and position their ships.
 
```Input Validation:```
 Functions were created to validate user input, ensuring that ships are positioned within the board limits and that the coordinates entered are valid.

```User Interface:```
 A text-based user interface was developed that guides the user through the game, providing clear feedback and instructions.
 
```Array Manipulation:```
Two-dimensional arrays were used to represent the game boards, allowing easy visualization and manipulation of the game state.

```Read and Write Files:```
Features have been implemented to write the current game state to a file and load a game from a file, allowing users to resume saved games.

```Game Logic:```
 Game logic was developed to manage the alternation of turns between the player and the computer, check whether a ship has been hit, and determine when the game ends.
 
_This project demonstrates skills in game development, array manipulation, user input validation, and reading/writing files in Kotlin. Furthermore, it shows the ability to create an intuitive user interface and develop complex game logic._
